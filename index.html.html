    <h1>HTML Introduction</h1>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.<br>
       HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.<br>
       HTML describes the structure of a Web page.<br>
       HTML consists of a series of elements.<br>
       HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.<br>
       HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.</p>

    <strong>CSS Introduction</strong>
    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.<br>
       CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.<br>
       CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.<br>
       External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</p>

    <strong>GitHub Introduction</strong>
    <p>Initialize Git on a folder, making it a Repository.<br>
       Git now creates a hidden folder to keep track of changes in that folder.<br>
       When a file is changed, added, or deleted, it is considered modified.<br>
       You select the modified files you want to Stage.<br>
       The Staged files are Committed, which prompts Git to store a permanent snapshot of the files.<br>
       Git allows you to see the full history of every commit.<br>
       You can revert back to any previous commit.<br>
       Git does not store a separate copy of every file in every commit, but keeps track of changes made in each commit!</p>

    <strong>AWS Introduction</strong>
    <p>In 2006, Amazon Web Services (AWS) began offering IT infrastructure services to businesses as web servicesâ€”now commonly known as cloud computing.<br>
       One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to replace upfront capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs that scale with your business.<br>
       With the cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance.<br>
       Instead, they can instantly spin up hundreds or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster.</p>
